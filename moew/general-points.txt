-Nuclear propulsion systems have potential benefits for 
space exploration: long-duration missions and high thrust 
capabilities.

-Past use of nuclear reactors in spacecraft 
(e.g., RORSAT satellites) was for generating electricity, 
not propulsion.

-Concepts for nuclear-powered spaceships include nuclear 
thermal propulsion (NTP) and nuclear electric propulsion (NEP).

-Technical, safety, and regulatory challenges must be addressed 
for developing nuclear-powered spaceships.

-Technical challenges: designing robust shielding, ensuring 
reactor safety, addressing potential accidents, nuclear waste
 disposal, space issues.

-Safety challenges: protecting astronauts from radiation
 exposure.

-Regulatory challenges: adherence to international treaties 
and regulations (e.g., Outer Space Treaty).

-Advancements in technology, rigorous testing, and careful 
consideration of safety and environmental concerns are
 necessary for the development and deployment of 
 nuclear-powered spacecraft
